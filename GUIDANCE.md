# Workshop Guidance: Agentic Workflow

## Objective

Build the "Digital Grade Checker" MVP from scratch by orchestrating a team of specialized AI agents. This guide outlines a structured workflow to manage context, ensure high-quality output, and practice a modern, human-led AI development process.

All agent personas and prompt templates referenced below are available in the `/prompts` directory of the workshop repository.

## Phase 1: Architect (Ideation & High-Level Planning)

**Goal:**  
Define the project's technical direction and create a high-level roadmap.

### Steps

1. **Initialize the Architect**
    - In your AI tool, create a new, clean chat thread.
    - Set the agent's persona by using the contents of `/prompts/personas/architect.md`.

2. **Start the Planning Session**
    - Use the initial prompt from `/prompts/canned/architect_initial.md`.
    - When prompted, paste the full contents of the `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` into the chat.

3. **Collaborate on the Design**
    - Engage the Architect in a back-and-forth discussion.
    - Challenge its suggestions, ask for alternatives, and guide it to a final decision on the tech stack and architecture.

4. **Generate the Handoff Document**
    - Once the design is finalized, use the prompt from `/prompts/canned/architect_handoff.md`.
    - The Architect will generate a handoff document for the next phase. Review and approve it. It will also create the root `TODO.md` file.

## Phase 2: Lead Developer (Implementation Planning)

**Goal:**  
Decompose the Architect's high-level plan into a detailed, actionable sprint backlog.

### Steps

1. **Initialize the Lead Developer**
    - Create a new, clean chat thread.
    - Set the agent's persona using `/prompts/personas/lead_developer.md`.

2. **Assign the First Epic**
    - Give the agent its first assignment by pasting the handoff document generated by the Architect in the previous phase.

3. **Refine the Implementation Plan**
    - Collaborate with the Lead Developer. Discuss its proposed plan for breaking down the task.
    - Guide its decisions to ensure the plan is logical and the sub-tasks are small and well-defined.

4. **Generate the Sprint Backlog**
    - Instruct the Lead Developer to create a `developer_todo.md` file. This file contains the final, agreed-upon list of implementation tasks.

## Phase 3: Implementer (Code Execution)

**Goal:**  
Write clean, working code for one specific task at a time.

### Steps

1. **Start a New Task Thread**
    - For the first task listed in `developer_todo.md`, create a new, clean chat thread.
    - Every new task from `developer_todo.md` must get its own isolated thread.

2. **Initialize the Implementer**
    - Set the agent's persona using `/prompts/personas/implementer.md`.

3. **Execute the Task**
    - Give the agent its instructions. You can do this by either pointing it to the relevant markdown file created by the Lead Developer or by directly pasting the specific task description from the `developer_todo.md`.

4. **Repeat**
    - Once the code is written and confirmed, return to step 1 for the next task in `developer_todo.md`. Continue until the backlog is
